The code consists of an exercise classification algorithm for the MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks, impletemented using PyTorch. 

Run 'python cnn_mnist_training.py' for the training algorithm. 
Run 'python cnn_mnist_visualization.py' for simple visualization of the original MNIST dataset.
